INSTRUCTIONS

Change the contained iSetup file with the one in this git

Run the start.sh

Enjoy :)


KNOWN ISSUES

checkra1n 0.10.2 works sometimes but is inconsistent

checkra1n 0.11 crashes nto pongoOS

checkra1n 0.12-0.12.1 does not boot into pongoOS


checkra1n 0.12.2-present does not load the image into pongoOS



Touchscreen functionality is not working currently

I have submitted an issue for Pongo to hopefully get the touchscreen functional (if it is a Pongo problem, may not be)
